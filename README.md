Airline Database Management System (DBMS)

This repository contains an Airline Reservation Database developed as part of the DBMS course at FORE School of Management. The project focuses on ER modeling, relational schema design, and SQL implementation of an airline management system using MySQL.

Key Components

* ER Diagram covering major airline entities such as Airport, Aircraft, Flight, Crew, Passenger, Booking, Seat Allocation, Payment, Ticket, and Baggage

* Relational schema with appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints

* Normalized tables to maintain data consistency and reduce redundancy

* Forward engineering SQL script for database creation and execution

* Basic documentation explaining entity relationships and design choices

Objectives

* To implement core DBMS concepts including ER modeling, cardinality, normalization, and referential integrity

* To model a real-world airline reservation system using structured relational data

Tools & Technologies

* MySQL

* MySQL Workbench

* SQL

This project demonstrates the application of database design principles to a practical airline reservation scenario.
